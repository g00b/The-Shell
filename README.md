# The Shell Updated for Ghost v5.73.2 + 

I found this minimalist Theme from a few years back. It has a very simplistic approach to blogging that I really enjoyed. I'll be using this project to bring it up to date with the current version of Ghost Blog v5.

# The Shell

Minimalistic dark color theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) platform.

Demo lives here: [https://ghostintheshell.ghost.io](https://ghostintheshell.ghost.io/).
